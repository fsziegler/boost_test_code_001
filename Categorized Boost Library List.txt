String and text processing
Conversion: Polymorphic and lexical casts.
Format: The format library provides a class for formatting arguments according to a format-string, as does printf, but with two major differences: format sends the arguments to an internal stream, and so is entirely type-safe and naturally supports all user-defined types; the ellipsis (...) can not be used correctly in the strongly typed context of format, and thus the function call with arbitrary arguments is replaced by successive calls to an argument feeding operator%.
Iostreams: Boost.IOStreams provides a framework for defining streams, stream buffers and i/o filters.
Lexical Cast: General literal text conversions, such as an int represented a string, or vice-versa, from Kevlin Henney.
Locale: Provide localization and Unicode handling tools for C++.
Regex: Regular expression library.
Spirit: LL parser framework represents parsers directly as EBNF grammars in inlined C++.
String Algo: String algorithms library.
Tokenizer: Break of a string or other character sequence into a series of tokens.
Wave: The Boost.Wave library is a Standards conformant, and highly configurable implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality packed behind an easy to use iterator interface.
Xpressive: Regular expressions that can be written as strings or as expression templates, and which can refer to each other and themselves recursively with the power of context-free grammars.

Containers
Array: STL compliant container wrapper for arrays of constant size.
Bimap: Bidirectional maps library for C++. With Boost.Bimap you can create associative containers in which both types can be used as key.
Circular Buffer: A STL compliant container also known as ring or cyclic buffer.
Container: Standard library containers and extensions.
Dynamic Bitset: The dynamic_bitset class represents a set of bits. It provides accesses to the value of individual bits via an operator[] and provides all of the bitwise operators that one can apply to builtin integers, such as operator& and operator<<. The number of bits in the set is specified at runtime via a parameter to the constructor of the dynamic_bitset.
GIL: Generic Image Library
Graph: The BGL graph interface and graph components are generic, in the same sense as the the Standard Template Library (STL).
ICL: Interval Container Library, interval sets and maps and aggregation of associated values
Intrusive: Intrusive containers and algorithms.
Multi-Array: Boost.MultiArray provides a generic N-dimensional array concept definition and common implementations of that interface.

Property Map: Concepts defining interfaces which map key objects to value objects.
Property Tree: A tree data structure especially suited to storing configuration data.

Iterators
GIL: Generic Image Library
Graph: The BGL graph interface and graph components are generic, in the same sense as the the Standard Template Library (STL).
Iterator: The Boost Iterator Library contains two parts. The first is a system of concepts which extend the C++ standard iterator requirements. The second is a framework of components for building iterators based on these extended concepts and includes several useful iterator adaptors.
Operators: Templates ease arithmetic classes and iterators.
Tokenizer: Break of a string or other character sequence into a series of tokens.

Algorithms
Algorithm: A collection of useful generic algorithms.
Foreach: In C++, writing a loop that iterates over a sequence is tedious. We can either use iterators, which requires a considerable amount of boiler-plate, or we can use the std::for_each() algorithm and move our loop body into a predicate, which requires no less boiler-plate and forces us to move our logic far from where it will be used. In contrast, some other languages, like Perl, provide a dedicated "foreach" construct that automates this process. BOOST_FOREACH is just such a construct for C++. It iterates over sequences for us, freeing us from having to deal directly with iterators or write predicates.
